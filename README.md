Machine learning homework assignment

## Background
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## Workflow
* Preprocess the raw data
* Tune the models
* Compare two or more models

## Tools Used
